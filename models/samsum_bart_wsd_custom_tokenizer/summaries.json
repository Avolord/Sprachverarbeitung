I have had a good.s.17 look.n.02 and have done some test.n.05 on the mold.n.06 in your excess.s.01 bedroom.n.01 upstairs.n.01 and in the dinign room.n.01 . Betty : hello.n.01 Andy . thank.v.01 you for that , what are your thinking.n.01 ? Andy : I think.v.02 it is induce.v.02 by condensation.n.03 , as most of the damp.s.01 settle.n.01 on and about.r.04 the window.n.07 . Betty : Why is that ? Andy : Those are the cold.a.01 area.n.05 and consequently.r.02 where the damp.s.01 in the warm.a.01 air_travel.n.01 turn.v.20 into water.n.03 . On the window.n.07 its just water.n.03 , on the wall.n.01 the damp.s.01 will leave.v.06 mold.n.06 to grow.v.07 . Betty : So why is it all over the excess.s.01 room.n.01 wall.n.01 , and all about.r.04 the dining.n.01 room.n.01 ? but not in other room.n.01 ? Andy : probably.r.01 because they have external.s.03 wall.n.01 which are cool.a.01 than inner.s.01 wall.n.01 . Betty : so why only that bedroom.n.01 and not the other one.n.01 ? Andy : I think.v.02 those room.n.01 are most accomplished.s.03 as the excess.s.01 room.n.01 is following.s.02 to the toilet.n.01 and the dining.n.01 room.n.01 following.s.02 to the kitchen.n.01 . Betty : But why isnt there shape.v.02 on the kitchen.n.01 and toilet.n.01 itself then ? Andy : I think.v.02 that is because the kitchen.n.01 does n't have external.s.03 wall.n.01 and the toilet.n.01 has only one.n.01 external.s.03 wall.n.01 and a fan.n.01 in it . The dispute.n.01 when i measure.v.01 it between inner.s.01 wall.n.01 and external.s.03 wall.n.01 is about four.s.01 degree.n.07 . Betty : Does that mean.n.01 we necessitate.v.01 new.s.05 double.s.06 sugarcoat.v.01 window.n.07 or new.s.05 wall.n.01 insulation.n.03 ? Andy : Not inevitably.r.01 . that would make.v.02 a little.a.02 dispute.n.01 but would still.r.04 leave.v.06 you with damp.s.01 air_travel.n.01 in the sign_of_the_zodiac.n.01 , so it would just settle.v.19 somewhere.r.01 elevation.n.03 . Betty : So what would you recommend.v.01 ? Andy : I would install.v.02 a fan.n.01 system.n.08 , or PIV system.n.08 , which would circulate.v.06 air_travel.n.01 to load.v.05 and aim.v.01 some moisture.n.01 out of the air_travel.n.01 . It would be install.v.02 in your loft.n.03 and be on continuously.r.01 during day.n.04 and night.n.06 . Betty : That sound.v.02 good.s.17 . would that be sufficient.a.01 ? Andy : If you buy.v.01 a decent.s.06 size.n.05 it will be , but you would besides.r.02 necessitate.v.01 to regale.v.01 your wall.n.01 to get.v.01 rid.v.01 of the current.a.01 mold.n.06 .
