Any good?\r\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It is about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\r\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\r\nClara: That is the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\r\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\r\nClara: Well, it is mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it is rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\r\nNeela: How is that?\r\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there is also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I am not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\r\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\r\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I will check it out soon!\r\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\r\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I am just watching the rest of a movie and I will try Dear White People.\r\nClara: Do not blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\r\nNeela: See ya, love!\r\nClara: Bye!",

    "Nancy: Yeah, but you can also read the news online ;)\r\nPhil: I know, but imagine - you are keen on technology and you get all the news in one place. Then you can choose what to read and what not.\r\nNancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion?\r\nPhil: Probably so. Not sure, though.\r\nNancy: How about you, Vic?\r\nVic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\r\nPhil: Well, it is intended in a completely different way. \r\nVic: What do you mean?\r\nPhil: I AM GOING TO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. YOU can follow anyone and anyone can follow you.\r\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I do not have to limit myself to 140 characters.\r\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if people were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\r\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\r\nVic: I do. \r\nPhil: Not 4 me. I do not post that many pictures online. \r\nNancy: But you can follow people and see what they are doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram.\r\nPhil: I know, but I am more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast. \r\nVic: That is not all people post on Instagram!\r\nPhil: So, what else?\r\nVic: Depends on you are interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :)\r\nPhil: And does this motivate you to train?\r\nVic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not. \r\nNancy: What do you think about Tumblr?\r\nPhil: What?\r\nVic: Heard about it, but never had an account.\r\nNancy: It is a microblogging website. YOU can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything you want there. And people can observe you!\r\nPhil: Do not have that much time to write a blog.\r\nVic: Me neither. \r\nPhil: Nancy, y do you ask these questions? ;)\r\nNancy: I have my reasons ;)",

What about general awareness? Plastic bags, etc.?\r\nRonnie: Very high. No more single use plastic bags in grocery stores. No more straws in restaurants.\r\nClint: Yeah, I read yours was one of the cities that banned them. I wonder when that will get here.\r\nRonnie: Never...\r\nClint:: What do you mean?\r\nRonnie: I highly doubt that type of environmental awareness will happen there. People there live in a different world when it comes to that.\r\nClint: People do not have to have any awareness, to be honest. It is above them. If there were such decisions made they would follow\r\nRonnie: That is true. But at the state government level I do not think there is that awareness either. But hopefully I am proven wrong!\r\nClint: Really bizarre. I noticed it is struggling here. On the other hand, it is money.\r\nRonnie: Money in the sense of?\r\nClint: Reducing waste=lower utilization costs.

Are you still interested?\r\nSophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.\r\nNoah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They are in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.\r\nSophie: That is very very kind of him! He is really a darling.\r\nSophie: We will not be going your direction any time soon I am afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\r\nNoah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\r\nSophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I will talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you as soon as possible.\r\nNoah: OK.\r\nSophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?\r\nNoah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Have not seen them for ages!\r\nSophie: Well we do not see that much of them either :( They will be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\r\nNoah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they do not fancy it so much.\r\nSophie: I do not blame them! We are both happy they have been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You do not have William at home all that often either, do you?\r\nNoah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we have learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\r\nSophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I would say. Like being married to your regiment!\r\nNoah: That is what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\r\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\r\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\r\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\r\nNoah: We think he is just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\r\nSophie: He is always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I would not worry at all.\r\nNoah: You are probably right. But you know I would love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\r\nSophie: They will come, do not you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\r\nNoah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!\r\nSophie: Thank you for the quince!",

    "Andy: Hello. I have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room.\r\nBetty: Hello Andy. Thank you for that, what are your thoughts? \r\nAndy: I think it is caused by condensation, as most of the moist settles on and around the windows.\r\nBetty: Why is that?\r\nAndy: Those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water. On the windows its just water, on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow.\r\nBetty: So why is it all over the spare room walls, and all around the dining room? but not in other rooms?\r\nAndy: Probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls.\r\nBetty: so why only that bedroom and not the other ones?\r\nAndy: I guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen.\r\nBetty: But why is not there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then?\r\nAndy: I think that is because the kitchen does not have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it. The difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees.  \r\nBetty: Does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation?\r\nAndy: Not necessarily. that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house, so it would just settle somewhere else.  \r\nBetty: So what would you recommend?\r\nAndy: I would install a fan system, or PIV system, which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air. It would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night. \r\nBetty: That sounds good. would that be sufficient? \r\nAndy: If you buy a decent size it will be, but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould. That will not go away by itself.\r\nBetty: OK, is this something your company can help with?\r\nAndy: It is indeed, we can repaint as well if you want. \r\nBetty: Good point. Could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email?\r\nAndy: Of course, I will have that done by Friday. \r\nBetty: That would be great. And again, thanks for today!\r\nAndy: No problem, speak soon.",

I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar.\r\nJohn: In 15 years I have never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR  for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team is not worth anything either.

    "Charles: How can you tell that someone has gluten intolerance?\nKaren: You can have coeliac disease which makes it impossible for you to digest gluten or be allergic to gluten. From what I have heard, being allergic is far worse, because you have an allergic reaction that can be lethal, while being intolerant can make feel you some unpleasant symptoms, but I do not think may lead to your death\nJack: Why are you asking? Is there something wrong?\nCharles: Hm, I do not know, I feel that I may be allergic or something\nMonica: Do you have any symptoms? Check those articles:\nMonica: <file_other>, <file_other>\nKaren: I think that you may have a very very light allergy at best, otherwise you would have known - trust me\nKaren: When it comes to intolerance... I know it is very hip to be gluten intolerant, but I do not believe that suddenly half of the population is gluten intolerant. Unless you have a coeliac disease, I think you are fine\nJack: My friend was told that she may be intolerant or allergic and she did a blood test - she is absolutely fine\nCharles: I may do it as well. I feel weird recently, bloated and I gain weight even though I do not eat much\nKaren: But do you feel differently after eating gluten? Jack's right, you should do a blood test first, but you can test it yourself. Stop eating gluten for a month and see if you feel better\nMonica: I did the same thing with lactose, I was not feeling great after drinking coffee with milk, etc. I stopped eating it and I am much better now\nJack: But did it happen suddenly or were you always like this?\nMonica: It just happened, I was all right until I was not. I do not know how it works, but it happens\nCharles: I think it is the same with me. I was fine, but recently it is a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation. Maybe it has nothing to do with food?\nCharles: I had a basic blood test and everything's fine. My GP said all my problems are linked to my diet\nKaren: It may be, but I am not so sure. Although, changing your diet and eating healthier cannot do you any harm\nMonica: You should read the articles I sent you, check the symptoms and what you should not eat\nCharles: Thanks! I am really worried, because it is getting worse and I have no idea what is happening with me",
